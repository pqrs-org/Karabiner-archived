### Step 1: Getting source code

Download the source to master.tar.gz in the current directory, this can be re-executed to restart a cancelled download.

    curl -OLC - https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/archive/master.tar.gz

Extract the master.tar.gz file to "Karabiner-master" and delete the tar.gz file

    tar -xvzf master.tar.gz && rm master.tar.gz

### Step 2: Building a package

    cd Karabiner-master
    make

The `make` script will create a redistributable **Karabiner-VERSION.dmg** in the current directory.


**Note:**
The build may fail if you have changed any environment variables or if you have modified scripts in the `/usr/bin` locations. Use a clean environment (new account) if this is the case.
